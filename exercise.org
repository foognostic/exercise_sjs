* TODO setup [3/3]
  - [X] pick a language: rust
    + not technically my strongest, but recently familiar and I want to do less Ruby
  - [X] pick a starting point
    + advent of code repository
    + existing code for reading .gitignored input data
  - [X] use a stable build of rust
    + 1.55 (current stable)
    + set edition to 2018
* TODO package solution
  - [ ] build a standalone crate?
  - [ ] use docker somehow to avoid installing rust?
  - [ ] put code on Github in a private repo
  - [X] avoid putting company name anywhere
  - [X] absolutely no input data allowed
